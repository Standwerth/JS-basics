// Constants

// Constants are variables that are immutable, i.e once their value has been set they can not be changed.

// Regular variable
let intrestRate = 0.3;
intrestRate = 1;
console.log(intrestRate);

//Constant
const staticIntrestRate = 0.5

// If we were to run the code with the line below uncommented, we would get an error.
//staticIntrestRate = 1.3;
console.log(staticIntrestRate);
