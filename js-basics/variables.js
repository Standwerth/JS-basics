 // Variables

 // Variables are objects that temporarily hold data.
 
 // The name of a variable cannot be a reserved keyword.
 // Names should be descriptive and meaningful. I.e not 'a' or 'b' but instead 'myScore'.
 // Names can not begin with a number.
 // Names cannot contain a space ( ) or Hyphen (-)

 let myName = 'Anton';
 console.log(myName);

// Names are case-sensitive 
let firstName = 'Adam';
let FirstName = 'John';

 // You can also declare multiple variables on a single line
 let firstName, lastName;

 // You can also initialize both variables on the same line
 let person1 = 'Sophie', person2 = 'Alex';

 // You could dedicde to initialize one of the variables only as well
 let petOne = 'Cat'; petTwo;

 // Modern convention is that you declare variables on its own separate line
 let objectOne = 'Car';
 let objectTwo = 'Boat';
